    "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a multilayered neural network with a special architecture to detect complex features in data, with most applications in image classification, self-driving vehicles, and medical image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs differ from multi-level perceptron networks (MLPs) by how regularization is applied. While the regularization of MLPs typically involve adjustments to how the loss function is calculated, CNNs take hierarchical data (such as that in images) and break complex patterns into smaller and simpler patterns, drastically reducing the number of learned parameters in the model. The result is faster computation and a lower likelihood of overfitting, even with highly complex datasets."

    "One of the challenges of utilizing MLP networks for computer vision is that the inputs can be quite large. Let's consider training an MLP network to detect the presence of cats in a 1-megapixel 8-bit RGB image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1-megapixel: the image contains 1 million pixels\n",
    "- 8-bit RGB: there are three color channels (red, green blue) that can each have a value between 0-255.\n",

    "If we were then feeding this into a 1000-neuron hidden layer, then our weight matrix $W$ would b a $(1000, 3M)$-dimensional matrix totalling 3 billion elements (and a bias term). Training 3 billion weights for each epoch (for one layer!) is far too computationally expensive for most computers to handle.\n",
